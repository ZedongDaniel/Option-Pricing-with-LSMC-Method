# Option-Pricing-with-LSMC-Method

This jupyter notebook is for the capstone project in FINA 4529 (Derivatives II) at Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota.  
The program simulates stock price based on the jump-diffusion model and pricing the American option using the Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) method, which is also called the least square monte carlo method.  
It also embedded the stratified sampling feature, one of the variance reduction techniques, into the simulating function to improve pricing efficiency.  
In the notebook and the project report, I compared two simulation methods and analyzed the stratified sampling method's convergence advantage.  
At the end of the notebook, I used the pricing function to price five actual options traded on the market and compared simulated prices with real traded prices.
